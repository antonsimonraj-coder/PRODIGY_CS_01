# PRODIGY_CS_01 — Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool 🔐

Author: Anton Simon  
Internship: Prodigy InfoTech — Cyber Security Track  
Task: 01 — Caesar Cipher (Beginner-Friendly Encryption Demo)


---

## 🔍 Project Summary

This project is my implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the earliest and simplest encryption methods. I built this tool as part of my cybersecurity internship to understand how classical ciphers work and how shifting characters in the alphabet can be used to hide information.

The program lets you enter a message and a shift value, then shows both the encrypted and decrypted results. It’s a simple, beginner-friendly way to learn the basics of cryptography and how substitution ciphers operate in a secure and controlled environment.
